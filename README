MODX Generator will take an original phpBB folder and compare it to a copy with applied modifications. The resulting diff is then converted to the MODX format. Copy, edit and inline actions are automatically generated.

MODX Generator can also be used to upgrade modifications and handles both directories and files.

The resulted MODX file can be imported to the MODX Creator to generate a MODX install file.
This is an automated tool, you need to carefully check through the generated edits before submitting for validation.

AutoMOD RC2 has limited support for multiple in-line finds, if your modification has edits with multiple in-line finds you should mention that in the author notes.

Do note that this tool is still in beta stage.
