Changes since 1.0.0-b1
Improved the README file.
config.php is renamed to generator_config.php to avoid confusion with other config files.
Some more file names added to the default ignore list.
Ignore version is a parameter to the script, so it's removed from the config.
Parses meta tags from other generators and puts them in the generated MODX file.
Changed the generator meta tag.
There are now default settings in generator_config.php for the script parameters.
Contextual finds, except for in-line finds.
Renamed -f --outfile to -m --modxfile.
Added -r, --root = Creates a root directory containing the files missing in old.
Added -f, --force = Replaces the root directory if it exists.
Added exit values so calling apps knows if it was successful.
Removed the third parameter to check_missing(), $args are global here.
old and new are now main parameters to the app so -o and -n are not needed. old needs to be first.
-o are still needed if there is a default setting that needs to be overridden.
